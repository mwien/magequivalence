# Code for "A New Constructive Criterion for Markov equivalence of MAGs"
This repository contains a Julia implementation of the C-SRC. It is compared with the algorithm proposed by Hu, Evans in "Faster Algorithms for Markov equivalence" (UAI'20; https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02310). To execute the experiments run
```julia
julia experiments.jl
```
The results are written to ```results.ans```.
